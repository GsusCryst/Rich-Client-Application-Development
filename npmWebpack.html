# What is npm?

## Node Package Manager

- Node.js is used to create tools to aid local task automation
- to make use of these Node-based tools(such as Grunt, Gulp, Webpack) the Node package manager(npm) was created
- it installs the packages(Tools) and provides a useful interface
- npm can install packages in local or global mode
- in local mode it installs in node_modules folder in your parent working directory
- this location is owned by the current user
- in global mode it installs in {prefix}/lib/node_modules/ which is owned by root
- on macOs/Linux you need sudo to install packages globally
- this could cause permission errors: [How to change this](#changing)

---

layout: true

# Installing Node.js

---

- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">download</a> Node.js for Windows/macOS/Linux
- for Linux, Node can be installed via package manager

```shell
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
```

- check for the path and version of Node.js:

```shell
$ which node //Windows 'where node'
/usr/bin/node //Windows 'C:\...\node.exe'
$ node --version
v6.11.4 //Windows v8.11.1
```

---

- to verify the installation use Node's REPL(Read-Eval-Print-Loop):

```shell
$ node
> console.log('Node is running');
Node is running
> .help
.break Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
.clear Alias for .break
.exit  Exit the repl
.help  Show repl options
.load  Load JS from a file into the REPL session
.save  Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file
> .exit
```

- check for the path and version of npm:

```shell
$ which npm // Windows 'where npm'
/usr/bin/npm // Windows 'C:\...\npm' and 'C:\...\npm.cmd'
$ npm --version
3.5.2 //Windows 5.6.0
```

---

layout: true

# Changing the Location of Global Packages

---

name: changing

- let's see what output **npm config** gives us

```shell
$ npm config list
; cli configs
user-agent = "npm/3.10.10 node/v6.10.3 linux x64"

; userconfig /home/user/.npmrc
prefix = "/home/user/.node_modules_global"

; node bin location = /usr/bin/nodejs
; cwd = /home/user
; HOME = /home/user
; "npm config ls -l" to show all defaults.
```

- this gives us information about the install
- get the current global location

```shell
$ npm config get prefix
/usr //Windows 'C:\...\AppData\Roaming\npm'
```

- this is the prefix to change, to install global packages in home directory

---

- to do that create a new directory in your home folder

```shell
$ cd ~ && mkdir .node_modules_global //Windows only mkdir
$ npm config set prefix=$HOME/.node_modules_global
//Windows 'prefix=%USERPROFILE%\.node_modules_global'
```

- the location to which global Node packages are installed has been altered
- this also creates a **.npmrc** file in the home directory

```shell
$ npm config get prefix
/home/sitepoint/.node_modules_global //Windows 'C:\...\.node_modules_global'
$ cat .npmrc //Windows 'type .npmrc'
prefix=/home/user/.node_modules_global
//Windows 'prefix=C:\...\.node_modules_global'
```

- install npm again, but in the new user-owned location

```shell
$ npm install npm --global
└─┬ npm@6.0.0
  ├── abbrev@1.1.1
....
└── write-file-atomic@2.3.0
```

---

- finally add **.node_modules_global/bin** to the **$PATH** environment variable
- for Linux/macOS add the following to **.profile**, **.bash** or **.bashrc** file and restart the terminal

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.node_modules_global/bin:$PATH"
```

- for Windows write the following in the command line

```shell
setx path "%USERPROFILE%\.node_modules_global;%PATH%"
```

- now **.node_modules_global/bin** will be found first and the correct version of npm will be used

```shell
$ which npm //Windows 'where npm'
/home/user/.node_modules_global/bin/npm
//Windows 'C:\...\.node_modules_global\npm' 
//and 'C:\...\.node_modules_global\npm.cmd'
$ npm --version
6.0.0
```

---

layout: false

# Installing Packages in Global Mode

- only the npm package is installed globally
- use the --global flag or the abbreviated -g
- install a package globally, example: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js" target="_blank">UglifyJS</a>

```shell
$ npm install uglify-js --global
/home/user/.node_modules_global/bin/uglifyjs -> 
/home/user/.node_modules_global/lib/node_modules/uglify-js/bin/uglifyjs
+ uglify-js@3.3.24
added 3 packages in 1s
```

- additional packages are installed, these are dependencies

---

# Listing Global Packages

- list the global packages which were installed

```shell
$ npm list --global
home/user/.node_modules_global/lib
├─┬ npm@6.0.0
│ ├── abbrev@1.1.1
│ ├── ansi-regex@3.0.0
│ ├── ansicolors@0.3.2
│ ├── ansistyles@0.1.3
....................
└─┬ uglify-js@3.3.24
  ├── commander@2.15.1
  └── source-map@0.6.1
```

- the output is verbose, --depth=0 changes this

```shell
$ npm list -g --depth=0
/home/user/.node_modules_global/lib
├── npm@6.0.0
└── uglify-js@3.3.24
```

- any package installed globally will become available from the command line

---

layout: true

# Installing Packages in Local Mode

---

name: installLocal

- to install packages locally, create a package.json file

```shell
$ npm init
package name: (project)
version: (1.0.0)
description: Demo of package.json
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
```

- press Enter to accept the defaults
- this will create a package.json file at the root of the project
- for a quicker way use 

```shell
$ npm init --y
```

---

```json
{
  "name": "project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

- the fields are self-explanatory except for main and scripts
- the main field is the primary entry point to the program
- the scripts field lets specify script commands that run in the lifecycle of your package
- to find out more visit <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json" target="_blank">package.json documentation on npm</a> and <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/guide-to-npm-as-a-build-tool/" target="_blank">using npm as a build tool</a>

---

- install a package, example: <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank">Underscore</a>

```shell
$ npm install underscore
npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
npm WARN project@1.0.0 No description
npm WARN project@1.0.0 No repository field.

+ underscore@1.9.0
added 1 package in 0.344s
```

- note that a lockfile is created
- a dependencies field has been added to package.json

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "underscore": "^1.9.0"
  }
}
```

---

layout: true

# Managing Dependencies with package.json

---

```json
...
"dependencies": {
*  "underscore": "^1.9.0"
}
```

- the caret at the front of the version number indicates that npm will pull the highest version of the package where only the major version matches
- unless a **package-lock.json** file is present
- the method of versioning dependencies (major.minor.patch) is known as <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/semantic-versioning-why-you-should-using/" target="_blank">semantic versioning</a>
- the new package was saved as a property of the **dependencies** field
- this is the default of npm and is used for packages that are required to run an application

---

- it is possible to save a package as **devDependency** by specifying a --save-dev flag
- **devDependencies** are packages used for development, e.g. running tests or transpiling code
- add **private: true** to **package.json** to prevent accidental publication of private repositories and to suppress warnings when running **npm install**
- the main reason to use **package.json** to specify a project's dependencies is protability
- for example: when someone else's code is cloned, only run **npm i** in the project root
- npm will resolve and fetch all the packages to run the app

---

layout: false
name: uninstallLocal

# Uninstalling Local Packages

- npm is a package manager so it must be able to remove a package
- example: Underscore is causing a compatibility problem

```shell
$ npm uninstall underscore
removed 1 package in 0.107s
$ npm list
project@1.0.0 /home/user/project
└── (empty)
```

---

# Installing a Specific Version of a Package

- to install a specific version, use the @ sign
- example: Underscore

```shell
$ npm install underscore@1.8.2
+ underscore@1.8.2
added 1 package in 1.574s

$ npm list
project@1.0.0 /home/user/project
└── underscore@1.8.2
```

---

layout: true

# Updating a Package

---

- check for outdated packages, example Underscore

```shell
$ npm outdated
Package     Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
underscore    1.8.2   1.9.0   1.9.0  project
```

- *Current* shows us the installed version
- *Wanted* tells the latest version of the package that can be upgraded without breaking the code
- *Latest* shows us the latest version of the package

- **package-lock.json** ensure that the dependencies remain the same on all machines the project is installed on
- it is automatically generated for any operation where npm modifies **node_modules** folder or **package.json** file

---

- example: Underscore from [earlier](#uninstallLocal)

```shell
$ npm update underscore
+ underscore@1.9.0
updated 1 package in 0.236s

$ npm list
project@1.0.0 /home/sitepoint/project
└── underscore@1.9.0
```

- execute **npm update** to update all outdated modules

---

layout: true

# Searching for Packages

---

- is there a node that does the same as **mkdir**?

```shell
$ npm search mkdir
NAME      | DESCRIPTION          | AUTHOR          | DATE       | VERSION
mkdir     | Directory crea…      | =joehewitt      | 2012-04-17 | 0.0.2
fs-extra  | fs-extra conta…      | =jprichardson…  | 2018-05-01 | 6.0.0
mkdirp    | Recursively mkdir,…  | =substack       | 2015-05-14 | 0.5.1
...
```

- found <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirp" target="_blank">mkdirp</a>
- now it can be installed as described [here](#installLocal)

---

layout: true

# Re-installing Project Dependencies

---

- install one more package, example: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request" target="_blank">request</a>

```shell
$ npm install request
+ request@2.85.0
added 54 packages in 13.24s
```

- check package.json

```json
"dependencies": {
    "request": "^2.85.0",
    "underscore": "^1.9.0"
},
```

- the dependencies list gets updated automatically
- if the package shouldn't be added to package.json just use **--no-save** argument

---

- install dependencies of a cloned project source code to another machine
- delete **node_modules** and execute **npm install**

```shell
$ rm -R node-modules
$ npm list
project@1.0.0 /home/user/project
├── UNMET DEPENDENCY request@^2.85.0
└── UNMET DEPENDENCY underscore@^1.9.0

npm ERR! missing: request@^2.85.0, required by project@1.0.0
npm ERR! missing: underscore@^1.9.0, required by project@1.0.0

$ npm install
added 57 packages in 1.595s
```

- **node_modules** folder gets recreated
- this way it is possible to share code without bloating the project and source repositories

---

layout: false

# Managing the Cache

- when npm installs a packages it keeps a copy, so there is no need to hit the network again
- these copies are cached in the **.npm** directory in the home path

```shell
$ ls ~/.npm
anonymous-cli-metrics.json  _cacache  _locks  npm  registry.npmjs.org
```

- this directory will get cluttered with old packages over time, so it's useful to clean it up

```shell
$ npm cache clean
```

- also the **node_module** folders can be purged, if multiple node projects are on the system to clean up

```shell
find . -name "node_modules" -type d -exec rm -rf '{}' +
```

---

# Aliases

- there are many ways of running npm commands
- a brief list of some commonly used npm aliases:

```shell
$ npm i <package> //install local package
$ npm i -g <package> //install global package
$ npm un <package> //uninstall local package
$ npm up //npm update packages
$ npm t //run tests
$ npm ls //list installed modules
$ npm ll || npm la //print additional package information while listing modules
```

- also multiple packages can be installed at once

```shell
$ npm i express moment lodash mongoose body-parser webpack ...
```

## 2. webpack4

1. What is webpack4?
2. setup using boilerplate
3. Modules
4. Loaders
5. Code Splitting
6. Plugins
7. Development
8. Links

# What is webpack4?

Webpack has become one of the most important tools for modern web development.

It’s primarily a module bundler for your JavaScript, but it can be taught to transform all of your front-end assets like HTML, CSS, even images.

It can give you more control over the number of HTTP requests your app is making and allows you to use other flavors of those assets (Pug, Sass, and ES8, for example).

Webpack also allows you to easily consume packages from npm.

---

# setup using boilerplate

The fastest way to start a react.js application is to use a boilerplate:

1. Make sure you have the latest Stable or LTS version of Node.js installed.
2. Clone this repo using: "git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git".
3. Move to the appropriate directory: "cd react-boilerplate".
4. Run "npm run setup" in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.
5. Run "npm start" to see the example app at "http://localhost:3000".
6. Run "npm run clean" to delete the example app.

---

# Modules

Modules can split up your large programs into many small, self-contained programs using import and export statements.

```js
const people = [
  {
    manager: "Jen",
    name: "Bob"
  },
...
]
export default people
```

```js
import people from "./people"
```
---

# Loaders
Loaders let you run preprocessors on files as they’re imported. This allows you to bundle static resources beyond JavaScript.


Babel Example:
```npm
npm install --save-dev "babel-loader@^8.0.0-beta" @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

webpack.config.js
```js
...
   module: {
     rules: [
       {
         test: /\.js$/,
         exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
         use: {
           loader: 'babel-loader',
         }
       }
     ]
...
```
---
# Loaders
This config prevents Babel from transpiling import and export statements into ES5. We’re now free to use modern language features, and they’ll be compiled down to ES5 that runs in all browsers.

.babelrc

```js
{
  "presets": [
    ["@babel/env", {
      "modules": false
    }]
  ],
  "plugins": ["syntax-dynamic-import"]
}
```
---
# Code Splitting

Code Splitting allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. It can be used to achieve smaller bundles and control resource load prioritization which, if used correctly, can have a major impact on load time.

webpack.config.js
```js
const path = require('path');
const HTMLWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    index: './src/index.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HTMLWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'Code Splitting'
    })
  ],
  output: {
    filename: '[name].bundle.js',
    chunkFilename: '[name].bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
};
```
---
# Code Splitting
As import() returns a promise, it can be used with async functions.

This requires using Babel with Syntax Dynamic Import Plugin:

index.js
```js
async function getComponent() {
  var element = document.createElement('div');
  const _ = await import(/* webpackChunkName: "lodash" */ 'lodash');
  element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');
  return element;
}
getComponent().then(component => {
  document.body.appendChild(component);
});
```
---
# Plugins
Plugins are here to help us split our code in clever ways and optimize things for production.

Standard Modes:
+ development
+ production (default)

config
```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'production'
};
```

```cli
webpack --mode=production
```
---
# Development
The webpack-dev-server provides you with a simple web server and gives you live reloading, so you don’t need to manually refresh the page to see changes.

The HotModuleReplacement plugin goes one step further than Live Reloading and swaps out modules at runtime without the refresh. When configured correctly, this saves a huge amount of time during development of single page apps. Where you have a lot of state in the page, you can make incremental changes to components, and only the changed modules are replaced and updated.

---
# Development
## HotModuleReplacement plugin
webpack.dev.js
```js
* const webpack = require('webpack')
  const merge = require('webpack-merge')
  const common = require('./webpack.common.js')

  module.exports = merge(common, {
    mode: 'development',
*   devServer: {
*     hot: true
*   },
*   plugins: [
*     new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()
*   ],
    ...
```
app.js
```js
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept()
}
```
