## Tool Description
Webpack has become one of the most important tools for modern web development. 

It’s primarily a module bundler for your JavaScript, but it can be taught to transform all of your front-end assets like HTML, CSS, even images. 

It can give you more control over the number of HTTP requests your app is making and allows you to use other flavors of those assets (Pug, Sass, and ES8, for example). 

Webpack also allows you to easily consume packages from npm.
