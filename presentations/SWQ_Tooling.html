# 1.0 Testing Functional JavaScript

---

### 1.1 Why Test?

- making sure that the code in the application does what is expected and keeps doing what is expected when it gets changed
- tests define an expected functionality under a defined set of circumstances
- there will be a warning until the code gets fixed
- tests in a nutshell:
    - Unit tests validate the functionality of isolated code
    - Integration tests verify the flow of data and the interaction of components
    - Functional tests look at the behaviour of the overall application
- tests can be written at any point in the coding process, but it is more efficient to write unit tests before writing the function
- this practice is known as <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/learning-javascript-test-driven-development-by-example/" target="_blank">test-driven development(TDD)</a>
 
---

### 1.2 Why Functional?

- functional programming allows to deal with the data and the behaviour of the application independently
- the application is build by creating a set of independent functions that work in isolation and don't rely on external state
- the result:
    - the code becomes almost self-documenting
    - tied clearly defined functions behave in consistent and understandable ways
- functional programming is often contrasted against imperative programming and object-oriented programming
- JavaScript can support all of these techniques and even mix-and-match them
- functional programming can be a worthwhile alternative to:
    - creating sequences of imperative code that track the state of the application across multiple steps until a result is returned
    - building an application out of interactions across complex objects that encapsulate the methods that apply to a specific data structure

---

### 1.3 How pure Functions work

- functional programming encourages to build an application out of tiny, reusable, composable functions that do a specific task and return the same value for the same input
- a function like this is called **pure function**:
    - doesn't rely on external state or variables
    - doesn't cause side effect or alter external variables
    - always return the same result for the same input
- another advantage: makes it easier to do unit testing
- therefore the code can be refactored without breaking essential functionality

---

layout: true

### 1.4 What makes Functional Code easy to test?

---

- writing tests for a pure function is trivial because every single input has a consistent output
- all that has to be done is setting the expectations and run them against the code
- no context needs to be established
- no inter-functional dependencies to keep track of
- no changing state outside of the function that needs to be simulated
- no variable external data sources to be mocked out
- there are a lot of testing options ranging from full-fledged frameworks to utility libraries and simple testing harnesses
- these include <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/" target="_blank">Jasmine</a>, <a href="https://mochajs.org/" target="_blank">Mocha</a>, <a href="http://airbnb.io/enzyme/" target="_blank">Enzyme</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/" target="_blank">Jest</a>, etc.
- each one has different advantages and disadvantages and best use cases

---

#### Jasmine

- Jasmine is a robust framework that can be used in a wide variety of circumstances
- create a HTML document that pulls the testing library locally/from CDN
```HTML
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Jasmine Test</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/
        2.6.1/jasmine.min.css">
</head>
<body>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/
        2.6.1/jasmine.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/
        2.6.1/jasmine-html.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/
        2.6.1/boot.min.js"></script>
</body>
```
- brings in the Jasmine library, along with Jasmine HTML boot script and styling

---

layout: true

### 1.5 Testing Functional JavaScript - The first Test

---

- this can be done in a separate document or by including it inside a **script tag** element on the page
- use the <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/api/2.6/global.html#describe" target="_blank">describe</a> function defined by the Jasmine library to describe the behaviour for a new function
- the example function to write will be called **isPalindrome** and will return **true** if the string passed is the same forward and backwards otherwise **false**
```js
describe("isPalindrome", () => {
        it("returns true if the string is palindrome", () => {
            expect(isPalindrome("abba")).toEqual(true);
        });
        it("returns false if the string isn't a palindrome", () => {
            expect(isPalindrome("Bubba")).toEqual(false);
        });
});
```
- add this to a script in the page and load it

---

- a working Jasmine report page will show up: <a href="testJasmineFail.html" target="_blank">click</a>

- this is the result that was expected because there is no function **isPalindrome**
- adding the **isPalindrome** function
```js
const isPalindrome = (str) => {
    return str
            .split("")
            .reverse()
            .join("") === str;
};
```
- results in: <a href="testJasmineSuccess.html" target="_blank">click</a>
- this code is a pure function

---

layout: true

### 1.6 Refactoring a pure Function

---

- at this point it is trivial to add additional functionality, such as handling non-string input, ignoring difference between upper and lower case, etc.
- add a test for a number (1001): <a href="testJasmineFail2.html" target="_blank">click</a>
```js
it("returns true if a number is a palindrome", () => {
        expect(isPalindrome(1001)).toEqual(true);
});
```
- update the script to handle non-string inputs and coercing them into strings: <a href="testJasmineSuccess2.html" target="_blank">click</a>
```js
return str
        .toString()
        .split("")
        .reverse()
        .join("") === str.toString();
```

# 2.0 Test NodeJS using Mocha, Chai, SinonJS

---

layout: true

### 2.1.1 Literature of Tools - Mocha

---

- <a href="https://mochajs.org/" target="_blank">Mocha</a> is a test runner, runs/executes tests
- install Mocha
```shell
> npm install -g mocha
```
- create new directory for the application
```shell
> mkdir testing-async-code && cd testing-async-code
> npm init
> npm install --save mocha
> mkdir tests
```
- add a basic test to see how Mocha works
```js
const assert = require("assert");
    describe("smoke test", function() {
        it("checks equality", function() {
            assert.equal(true, true);
        });
});
```

---

- to run this run the command **mocha** and pass the directory of the tests
```shell
> mocha tests/
```
- the tests passed
- to let the test fail, adjust the file
```js
const assert = require("assert");
    describe("smoke test", function() {
        it("checks equality", function() {
            assert.equal(true, false);
        });
});
```
- the tests stop

---

layout: false

### 2.1.2 Literature of Tools - Chai

- <a href="http://www.chaijs.com/" target="_blank">Chai</a> is a assertion library
- install
```bash
> npm i --save-dev chai
```
- change the smoke test to
```js
const chai = require("chai");
const expect = chai.expect;
describe("smoke test", function() {
        it("checks equality", function() {
            expect(true).to.be.true;
        });
});
```

---

### 2.1.3 Literature of Tools - SinonJS

- <a href="http://sinonjs.org/" target="_blank">SinonJs</a> provides stand alone test spies, stubs and mocks
- install
```bash
> npm i --save-dev sinon
```
- Spies:
    - creates fake functions which can be used to track executions (also for existing functions)
    - tracks if the function has been executed/how many times its been called etc.
- Stubs:
    - enables the replacement of functions
    - gives more control
    - can return what ever is needed
    - have functions work in a way that suites to be able to test multiple scenarios
- Mocks:
    - fake methods that have pre-programmed behaviour and expectations

---

layout: true

### 2.2 **Spies**, Stubs, Mocks

---

- create a new file in your project folder: /controllers/app.controller.js to use Spies, Stubs and Mocks


- example function for the endpoint
```js
module.exports = {
// A func that takes in two parameters `req` and `res` [request, response]
        getIndexPage: (req, res) => {
            res.send("Hey");
        }
}
```
- to test this a function that takes two parameters is required

---

- create a new file inside the tests folder: /tests/controllers/app.controller.tests.js
```js
const chai = require("chai");
const expect = chai.expect;
// import the getIndexPage function
const indexPage = require("../../controllers/app.controller.js");
describe("getIndexPage", function() {
        it("should return index page", function() {
            let req = {}
// res has a send key with a function value because res.send() in function
            let res = {
                send: function() {}
            }
            indexPage.getIndexPage(req, res)
        });
});
```
- this doesn't give anything to test or much control over the function
- use a spy and make some assertions on the spy

---

- making assertions on a spy is possible because the spy gives a dummy function that can be used to track the functions execution
```js
[...]
const expect = chai.expect;
// import sinon
*const sinon = require("sinon");
const indexPage = require("../../controllers/app.controller.js");
[...]
        let req = {}
        let res = {
 *      send: sinon.spy()
        }
        indexPage.getIndexPage(req, res);
        // let's see what we get on res.send
 *   console.log(res.send);
[...]
```
- now a test can be run with the **mocha** command
- a list of all methods that can be used to make assertions for the tests is returned by **res.send**

---

- adding some of these assertions
    - expect **res.send** is called once
    - expect the argument **Hey** on the first call

```js
[...]
        console.log(res.send);
        // res.send called once
 *       expect(res.send.calledOnce).to.be.true;
        // expect to get argument "bla" on first call
 *       expect(res.send.firstCall.args[0]).to.equal("bla");
    });
});
```
- the result will be a failing test because the expected argument was **bla** instead of **Hey**
- replacing **bla** with **Hey** in the code and running the test again will result in passing the test

---

- to spy on an already existing function simulate a scenario by defining a function

```js
[...]
const indexPage = require("../../controllers/app.controller.js");
*const user = {
*  addUser: (name) => {
*      this.name = name;
*  }
*}
describe("AppController", function() {
    [...]
    expect(res.send.firstCall.args[0]).to.equal("Hey");
});
*describe("User", function() {
*   describe("addUser", function() {
*       it("should add a user", function() {
*           sinon.spy(user, "addUser");
           // lets log `addUser` and see what we get
*           console.log(user.addUser);
*       });
*   });
*});
```
- see **console.log** to get all the watch  functionality on the already existing function

---

- make some assertions on this function

```js
[...]
describe("User", function() {
    describe("addUser", function() {
        it("should add a user", function() {
            sinon.spy(user, "addUser");
*           user.addUser('John Doe');
            // lets log `addUser` and see what we get
            console.log(user.addUser);
*           expect(user.addUser.calledOnce).to.be.true;
        });
    });
});
```

- most of the time spies probably won't be used but they are useful to test if callbacks have been called and how many times during the code execution

---

layout: true

### 2.2 Spies, **Stubs**, Mocks

---

- have all functionality of spies but they replace the whole function
- this helps in specific scenarios
    - external calls which make tests slow and difficult to write (e.g. HTTP/DB calls)
    - triggering different outcomes for a piece of code (e.g. what happens if an error is thown/if it passes)
- add a function to **/controllers/app.controller.js** just to broaden the scope of things to test

```js
module.exports = {
    getIndexPage: (req, res) => {
*        if (req.user.isLoggedIn()) {
*            return res.send("Hey");
*        }
*        res.send("Ooops. You need to log in to access this page");
    }
}
```
- now the function checks if the user **isLoggedIn** to send **Hey** or otherwise another message

---

- imagine an expensive operation happening that returns **true** when the user is logged in, otherwise **false**

```js
[...]
        it("should send hey when user is logged in", function() {
            // instantiate a user object with an empty isLoggedIn function
*           let user = {
*               isLoggedIn: function(){}
*           }
            // Stub isLoggedIn function and make it return true always
*           const isLoggedInStub = sinon.stub(user, "isLoggedIn").returns(true);
            // pass user into the req object
            let req = {
*               user: user
            }
            let res = {
                ...
            }
            indexPage.getIndexPage(req, res);
            expect(res.send.calledOnce).to.be.true;
            expect(res.send.firstCall.args[0]).to.equal("Hey");
            // assert that the stub is logged in at least once
*           expect(isLoggedInStub.calledOnce).to.be.true;
        });
    });
});
```

---

- the function **isLoggedIn** is stub out and returns always **true** for this case
- the stub replaces **isLoggedIn** and scenarios where the user is logged in can be tested
- add the test when the user is logged out by making the stub return false

```js
[...]
*       it("should send something else when user is NOT logged in", function() {
*           let user = {
*               isLoggedIn: function(){}
*           }
*           const isLoggedInStub = sinon.stub(user, "isLoggedIn").returns(false);
*           let req = {
*               user: user
*           }
*           let res = {
*               send: sinon.spy()
*           }
*           indexPage.getIndexPage(req, res);
*           expect(res.send.calledOnce).to.be.true;
*           expect(res.send.firstCall.args[0]).to.equal("Ooops".+ 
*                   "You need to log in to access this page");
            // assert that the stub is logged in at least once
*           expect(isLoggedInStub.calledOnce).to.be.true;
*       })
    });
});
```

---

layout: true

### 2.2 Spies, Stubs, **Mocks**

---

- mocks can specify how something should work and use **mock.verify()** to make sure it works
- this results in less and cleaner code
- the existing tests could
    - mock the **res** object
    - expect **send** to be called once with the argument **Hey**
    - then call **mock.verify()**

```js
[...]
            let res = {
                send: function(){}
            }
            // mock res
*           const mock = sinon.mock(res);
            // build how we expect it t work
*           mock.expects("send").once().withExactArgs("Hey");
            indexPage.getIndexPage(req, res);
            expect(isLoggedInStub.calledOnce).to.be.true;
            // verify that mock works as expected
*           mock.verify();
        });
    });
});
```

layout: true

### 2.3.1 Testing Async Code - Callbacks

---

- JS is inherently asynchronous so testing async code happens frequently
- create asny code and test it
- create the file **tests/asyncFunc.test.js**

```js
const chai = require("chai");
const expect = chai.expect;
// This is just an async func that takes in a bool and calls a callback
// that returns a message depending on the bool value
function someMadeUpAyncFunc(boolValue, cb) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        cb(boolValue ? "You get a sweet :)" : "You get nothing!!")
    }, 0);
}
// Added the `only` tag to have only this set of tests to run
describe.only("AsyncTest", function()  {
    it("should return `You get a sweet :)` if `true` is passed in", function() {
        someMadeUpAyncFunc(true, function(sweetCheck){
            expect(sweetCheck).to.equal("You get a sweet :)");
        });
    });
    it("should return `You get nothing!!` if `false` is passed in", function() {
        someMadeUpAyncFunc(false, function(sweetCheck){
            // Let's fail it on purpose just to see what happens
            expect(sweetCheck).to.equal("You get a sweet :)");
        });
    });
});
```

---

- all tests are passing but the last test should fail
- Mocha is expectin an exception to be thrown but this isn't happening
- the tests are running synchronously even though the function takes some time
- the tests finish executing before the function gets the chance to complete
- the way to tell the tests that something is expected is by adding a key word
- for example **done**, this alerts Mocha to wait until **done** is called

```js
[...]
*it("should return `You get a sweet :)` if `true` is passed in", function(done) {
    someMadeUpAyncFunc(true, function(sweetCheck){
        expect(sweetCheck).to.equal("You get a sweet :)");
*       done();
    });
});
*it("should return `You get nothing!!` if `false` is passed in", function(done) {
    someMadeUpAyncFunc(false, function(sweetCheck){
        // Let's fail it on purpose just to see what happens
        expect(sweetCheck).to.equal("You get a sweet :)");
*       done();
    });
[...]
```

- now the failing test can be seen

---

layout: true

### 2.3.2 Testing Async Code - Promises

---

- testing async functions with **promises** is different than using callbacks
- first install **chai-as-promised** to allow to test promises using Chai
```bash
> npm i --save-dev chai-as-promised
```
- we change the example to use promises instead of callbacks (**done** not needed)

```js
const chai = require("chai");
const expect = chai.expect;
*chai.use(require("chai-as-promised"));
function someMadeUpAyncFunc(boolValue, cb) {
*   return new Promise(function(resolve){
        setTimeout(function() {
*           resolve(boolValue ? "You get a sweet :)" : "You get nothing!!")
        }, 0);
    })
}
[...]
*       return expect(someMadeUpAyncFunc(true)).to.eventually.equal("You get a sweet :)");
    });
    it("should return `You get nothing!!` if `false` is passed in", function() {
*       return expect(someMadeUpAyncFunc(false)).to.eventually.equal("You get nothing!!");
    });
});
```

# 3.0 Snapshot Testing React with Jest

---

layout: true

### 3.1 What is a Snapshot Test?

---

- a snapshor test verifies that a piece of functionality works the same as it did when the snapshot was created
- it's like taking a picture of an application in a certain state and then being able to automatically verify that nothing has changed
- Example, list of 3 things:
```
A new Hope
The Empire Strikes Back
Return of the Jedi
```
- a snapshot can manually be taken by copying and pasting the HTML representation into a file
```HTML
<ul class="todo-list">
        <li class="todo-item">A New Hope</li>
        <li class="todo-item">The Empire Strikes Back</li>
        <li class="todo-item">Return of the Jedi</li>
</ul>
```
- later it could be verified that the component still works correctly by rendering the same data and comparing it to the rendered HTML

---

- this was essentially what a snapshot test does
- the first time it runs, it saves a textual snapshot of the component
- the next time, it compares the rendered component to the snapshot
- if they differ, the test fails
- now the snapshot could be updated or the component be fixed to match it
- the component should already work before the test is written because snapshot testing is not TDD
- create install create react app and create a project
```bash
> npm i -g create-react-app
> create-react-app snapshot-testing
```

---

layout: true

### 3.2 Introducing Jest

---

- <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html" target="_blank">Jest</a> is a test runner that also comes with expectations (**expect** function), mocks and spies
- Jest provides everything in one package like Mocha, Sinon and Chai
- also it provides the snapshot testing, which no other tools currently have
- it is included in Create React App
- the example project created by Create React App comes with one test to start with
```bash
> npm test
```
- this command runs all the test in "watch" mode, this means that after running all tests once, it will watch for changes to files and re-run the tests for the files that changed
- the result should be somthing like this
```bash
PASS src/App.test.js
  +  renders without crashing (11ms)
```
- Jest's built-in watch mode will also re-run tests for files that import files that have changed

---

layout: true

### 3.3 Setting Up Snapshot Testing

---

- example: **App.test.js**

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
    const div = document.createElement('div');
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
});
```

- this verfies that the test runner(Jest) is working
- to add a snapshot:
    - import at the top
    
    ```js
    import renderer from 'react-test-renderer'; // snapshot renderer
    ```
    - install react-test-renderer
    ```bash
    > npm i --save-dev react-test-renderer
    ```

---

- start the test in watch mode again
- if there is an error an older version of React is in use
- to work around add this line under the imports of **App.test.js**

```js
jest.mock('react-dom');
```

- running the test again should work now

### 3.4 Add a Snapshot Test

---

- add this code at the bottom of **App.test.js** for the first snapshot test

```js
it('renders a snapshot', () => {
    const tree = renderer.create(<App/>).toJSON(); // pass React element in JSX
                                                   // form and gets turned 
                                                   // into JSON
    expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot(); // if a snapshot already exists it compares
                                    // if a snapshot doesn't exist it creates one
});
```

- the snapshot will be saved/compared with the snapshot in the directory **__snapshots__**
- it will look for **App.test.js.snap** to compare with **App.test.js**
- these snapshot files should be checked into source control along with the rest of the code

---

- every call will create a new entry in the snapshot file that contains
```json
exports[`test renders a snapshot 1`] = `
    <div
        className="App">
        <div
            className="App-header">
            <img
                alt="logo"
                className="App-logo"
                src="test-file-stub" />
            <h2>
                Welcome to React
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p
            className="App-intro">
            To get started, edit
            <code>
                src/App.js
            </code>
             and save to reload.
        </p>
</div>
`;
```

### 3.5 Failed Snapshot Tests

---

- open **src/App.js** and delete this line

```js
<h2>Welcome to React</h2>
```

- run the test and the output should be something like(it shows the difference)

```bash
FAIL src/App.test.js
 -  renders a snapshot
    expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()
    Received value does not match stored snapshot 1.
    
    - Snapshot  // the lines with "-" were expected, but missing
    + Received  // the lines with "+" were not expected
        [...]   // the other lines are unchanged
*    -   <h2>
*    -       Welcome to React
*    -   </h2>
        [...]
        at Object.<anonymous>.it    (src/App.test.js:13:16)
        at process._tickCallback    (internal/process/next_tick.js:103:7)
  + renders without crashing (8ms)
  - renders a snapshot (9ms)
Snapshot Summary
  > 1 snapshot test failed in 1 test suite. Inspect your code changes or 
    press 'u' to update them.
```

layout: true

### 3.6 Updating Snapshot Tests

---

- example: making the header smaller
- change **h2** tags to **h3**, the test will fail
- a great feature of Jest comes in handy:
    - hitting the **u** key to replace the incorrect snapshot
- the test will re-run and pass this time

---

layout: true

### 3.7 Create a New Component with Tests

---

- create a new component and use snapshot tests to verify it works
- it will be a simpe counter component that doesn't allow negative numbers
- create the file **src/PositiveCounter.js**

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
export default class PositiveCounter extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }
    increment = () => { this.setState({
            count: this.state.count + 1
        });
    }
    decrement = () => { this.setState({
            count: Math.max(0, this.state.count - 1)
        });
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <span> Value: {this.state.count}
                <button className="decrement" onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>
                <button className="increment" onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
            </span>
        );
    }
}
```

---

- before writing a snapshot test, verify that the component works as expected manually
- open **src/App.js** and import the new PositiveCOunter at the top
```js
import PositiveCounter from './PositiveCounter';
```
- then put it inside the render method
```js
class App extends Component {
        render() { return (
                <div className="App">
                    <PositiveCounter/>
                   ...
                </div>
            );
        }
}
```
- starting the app should show the new counter
- now "+" and "-" can be clicked and the number shouldn't go below 0

---

- write the snapshot tests, create new file **src/PositiveCounter.test.js**
```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import PositiveCounter from './PositiveCounter';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
it('should render 0', () => {
        const tree = renderer.create(<PositiveCounter/>).toJSON();
        expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
- the test should show "1 snapshot written in 1 test suite" and the test will pass
- to see what is rendered open **src/__snapshots__/PositiveCounter.test.js.snap**

---

- add a test that increments the counter
```js
it('should render 2', () => {
        const component = renderer.create(<PositiveCounter/>);
        component.getInstance().increment();
        component.getInstance().increment();
        expect(component.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
- the test will pass and the snapshot file will verify that it rendered "2" for this test
- notice that the button is not actually clicked, to click the button itself write
```js
component.toJSON().children[3].props.onClick()
```
- test that the counter can't go negative
```js
it('should not go negative', () => {
        const component = renderer.create(<PositiveCounter/>);
        component.getInstance().increment();
        component.getInstance().decrement();
        component.getInstance().decrement();
        expect(component.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
