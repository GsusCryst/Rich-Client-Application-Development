# 1.0 Testing Functional JavaScript

## 1.1 Why Test?

- making sure that the code in the application does what is expected and keeps doing what is expected when it gets changed
- tests define an expected functionality under a defined set of circumstances
- there will be a warning until the code gets fixed
- tests in a nutshell:
    - Unit tests validate the functionality of isolated code
    - Integration tests verify the flow of data and the interaction of components
    - Functional tests look at the behaviour of the overall application
- tests can be written at any point in the coding process, but it is more efficient to write unit tests before writing the function
- this practice is known as <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/learning-javascript-test-driven-development-by-example/" target="_blank">test-driven development(TDD)</a>
 
---

## 1.2 Why Functional?

- functional programming allows to deal with the data and the behaviour of the application independently
- the application is build by creating a set of independent functions that work in isolation and don't rely on external state
- the result:
    - the code becomes almost self-documenting
    - tied clearly defined functions behave in consistent and understandable ways
- functional programming is often contrasted against imperative programming and object-oriented programming
- JavaScript can support all of these techniques and even mix-and-match them
- functional programming can be a worthwhile alternative to:
    - creating sequences of imperative code that track the state of the application across multiple steps until a result is returned
    - building an application out of interactions across complex objects that encapsulate the methods that apply to a specific data structure

---

## 1.3 How pure Functions work

- functional programming encourages to build an application out of tiny, reusable, composable functions that do a specific task and return the same value for the same input
- a function like this is called **pure function**:
    - doesn't rely on external state or variables
    - doesn't cause side effect or alter external variables
    - always return the same result for the same input
- another advantage: makes it easier to do unit testing
- therefore the code can be refactored without breaking essential functionality

---

## 1.4 What makes Functional Code easy to test?

- writing tests for a pure function is trivial because every single input has a consistent output
- all that has to be done is setting the expectations and run them against the code
- no context needs to be established
- no inter-functional dependencies to keep track of
- no changing state outside of the function that needs to be simulated
- no variable external data sources to be mocked out
- there are a lot of testing options ranging from full-fledged frameworks to utility libraries and simple testing harnesses
- these include <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/" target="_blank">Jasmine</a>, <a href="https://mochajs.org/" target="_blank">Mocha</a>, <a href="http://airbnb.io/enzyme/" target="_blank">Enzyme</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/" target="_blank">Jest</a>, etc.
- each one has different advantages and disadvantages and best use cases

# 1.4 What makes Functional Code easy to test? - Jasmine

---

- Jasmine is a robust framework that can be used in a wide variety of circumstances
- create a HTML document that pulls Jasmine testing library locally or from a CDN

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Jasmine Test</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/
            2.6.1/jasmine.min.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/
            2.6.1/jasmine.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/
            2.6.1/jasmine-html.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jasmine/
            2.6.1/boot.min.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

- this brings in the Jasmine library, along with Jasmine HTML boot script and styling
- the body is empty and is waiting for JavaScript to test and the Jasmine tests
